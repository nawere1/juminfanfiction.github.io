you didn’t want him to go against his morals. 
<br><br>“Babe stop for a second.”
 
<br><br>He looked up at you with hooded eyes, lips still attached to your soft skin and you were tempted to let him continue, but you shook your head and smirked, “My turn.”
 
<br><br>He sat up and this time you took control. Your lips crashed against his, bringing back the initial passion of the night. You pushed him down with one hand while the other gripped the hair at the nape of his neck. This time you were on top, quite literally. You could feel him (*hehe) underneath you, and although you didn’t want to go too far tonight, you squirmed atop him, teasing him a little, feeling him stiffen. He grunted into the kiss and you broke away to see his reaction; his eyes were wide which only made you continue. 
 
<br><br>“Y/N--” he moaned softly and grabbed your hips, pressing you into himself. You ran your fingers up and down his chest, bringing your face down towards his neck, kissing him like he did you.
 
<br><br>As the evening wore on, you continued your little games until the two of you felt you’d made the most of your night in that respect.

<br><br>“Aren’t you glad you didn’t go home tonight?” Jumin asked.
 
<br><br>“So glad,” you said staring at the Christmas tree across from you. You were laying on the couch after the intense makeout session that had just occurred, snuggled together under a warm blanket.
 
<br><br>With the wine and snacks forgotten and Elizabeth III fast asleep on her little bed nearby, you and Jumin made light pleasant conversation.
 
<br><br>“What’s Jaehee doing for Christmas?” you wondered aloud. “I hope you’re not making her work.”
 
<br><br>“Well,” Jumin began, “She’s scheduled to work a few hours—” You elbowed him in the ribs before he could finish his sentence. “Just kidding, she’s free that day.”
 
<br><br>“Good >:).”
