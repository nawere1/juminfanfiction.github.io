“I’ll have my chefs do that for you, I know they won’t mind.”
 
<br><br>“But they don’t have my mom’s recipes.”
 
<br><br>“Then write them down,” he retorted, leaning into you even more.
 
<br><br>You glared at him and tried to push him off. Did this man have a comeback for everything?
 
<br><br>“Actually, I didn’t even finish decorating my house and I planned to do that when I got back home tonight, so I should get going.”
 
<br><br>“Y/N you live alone, that’s so unnecessary. If you want a decorated house, just stay here and look at mine.”
 
<br><br>You only just noticed the massive, brightly lit Christmas tree sitting in the corner of the living room and white fairy lights strung across the walls and bordering the doorframes.
 
<br><br>“Ohh they’re nice,” you were momentarily mesmerized until, “...Wait! You live alone too so why are you allowed to decorate but I’m not?!”
<br><br>“Y/N first of all, I don’t live alone, I live with Elizabeth III and--” as if on cue, the elegant white cat slinked into the room and curled up at Jumin’s socked feet, “--second of all, I didn’t put these up, my housekeepers did.”
 
<br><br>You huffed, irritated at the fact that your boyfriend’s quick wit and smart mouth shutdown everything you said, but you weren’t about to let him win.
 
<br><br>“My mom will get worried.”
 
<br><br>“Tell her you’re with me. She loves me.”
 
<br><br>“I left my stove on.”
 
<br><br>“Liar,” he wrapped his arms around you and wouldn’t budge. “Accept defeat.”
 
<br><br>“Babe! Why do you want me to sleep over tonight? You’re usually so strict about this kind of thing...”
