emotional connection rather than the sexual one, sleeping over had never been a major part of your relationship. Despite this, today felt special and exciting--maybe it was the holiday season getting to your head--and you were looking forward to spending the remainder of the day with your man. His being so adamant toward you staying made you feel loved, and more importantly, put you in the perfect position for the surprise gift you had prepared in the event that you spent the night.
<br><br>You stepped out of the shower, toweled yourself off, and dressed in the pajama set you had purchased earlier that day while Jumin was buying your gingerbread cookie. It was a couples set: yours was a pair of wine colored silky satin bottoms patterned with little brown reindeer and a matching camisole and button up, while Jumin’s was just the pants and button up.

<br><br>While you waited for Jumin, you busied yourself with exploring the parts of his not-so-humble abode that you hadn’t yet seen. You peeked into his dark bedroom, and finding nothing of interest, you looked through his fridge and kitchen cupboards, then made your way to the living room to look through his record collection. Finding a record you thought would be fitting for the occasion, you pulled it out and set it on the player. The familiar melody of “Baby, It’s Cold Outside” played softly as it spun.
<br><br>After some time, you got bored and powered on the flat screen mounted above the fireplace and began flipping through channels. The classic Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer movie with the uncanny stop motion was on, and finding nothing better to watch, you let it play. It had been
