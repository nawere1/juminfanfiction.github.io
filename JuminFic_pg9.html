Jumin nervously cleared his throat and made a mental note to call Jaehee in the morning to tell her that she’d didn’t have to go to the office. After all, what kind of sick and twisted boss would he be if he made his assistant work on a day she should spending with her family?
 
<br><br>“Yoosung and Seven went to an arcade and karaoke bar,” Jumin said, hastily changing the subject, “and based on Yoosung’s posts, it looks like Saeran joined them and they’re sleeping over at Seven's place.”
 
<br><br>“Saeran’s with them?!” You reached for your phone to look through Yoosung’s Instagram. You grinned, watching the boys playing and singing and eating. “Aww this is so sweet,” you teared up a little, elated that they had all spent Christmas Eve together, especially because Saeran looked to be much happier since the last time you saw him.
<br><br>“Dare I say our night was much sweeter than theirs?” Jumin took your phone and set it on the table beside him.
 
<br><br>“Much sweeter,” you kissed his cheek. “Hmm, but why wasn’t Zen with them?” you questioned.
 
<br><br>“I don’t concern myself with the business of that wretched man,” Jumin huffed.
 
<br><br>“Jumin…” you started sternly.
 
<br><br>“Ah, I apologize, I must be drunk.”
 
<br><br>“You don’t even get drunk,” you rolled your eyes. You checked your phone again and saw that Zen had spent the day with his theater troupe. Jumin mentioned that V had called him earlier from Europe to wish them a Merry Christmas, so it seemed that all the RFA members were doing well.
 
<br><br>You and Jumin continued your conversation throughout the night, giggling and poking fun at one another until eventually, his responses to your words became fewer and farther in between as his breathing slowed. You lay half asleep and felt the rise and fall of his warm chest against your back and his arm loosely draped over your waist. You sleepily recalled the events of the day, smiling, and the exhaustion suddenly hit you twofold. Drifting in and out of sleep, you intertwined your fingers with Jumin’s, turning to face him and snuggle into his chest.
 
<br><br>The storm outside was as wild as ever, the wind whipping and the snow swirling, but none of that mattered. “Baby, It’s Cold Outside" continued playing softly on the record player and you smiled at the irony.
