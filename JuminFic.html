“What took you so long?”
<br><br>“That place was horribly crowded,” your boyfriend Jumin replied with a shiver as you stood up from the bench you had been waiting on. “I struggle to see the appeal in such novel desserts,” he said with a genuine look of confusion on his face.
 <br><br>"Gingerbread cookies are a Christmas staple," you replied, taking the cookie and thanking him. "Of course there'd be a lot of people there."
<br>"Hmm," he shrugged and held you close as you walked through the elaborate downtown Christmas village, his arm resting on your waist.
<br><br>Your date was coming to an end as the sun began to set. Earlier in the day, Jumin had taken you to an amusement park, you had eaten a homely lunch at a nearby family restaurant, and finally, you had walked to the Christmas village in town. While enjoying the last of the light shows and the blaring Christmas music, the two of you passed a booth where children were taking pictures with Santa.
 
<br><br>“How odd,” Jumin observed. “Why would parents allow their children to sit on the lap of a strange man dressed as a fictious holiday character?”
 
<br><br>You laughed. “It’s not odd, it’s a Christmas tradition! But you do have a point…”
<br><br>“Interesting. And that eggnog they were selling at the dessert booth? It’s fascinating that people would even drink such a beverage.” 
<br><br>“Yeah I don’t know about all of that,” you agreed.
<br><br>You held hands as you made your way through the winding paths, enjoying the looks of unabashed curiosity on your boyfriend’s face as he came across things he’d never experienced before, having been raised in an environment that was insulated from the "common people".
<br><br>After some time, Jumin received a call from Driver Kim letting him know he had arrived to pick the two of you up when you were ready. You made your way to the discussed meeting spot and the two of you got into the car. You greeted the driver and the black SUV pulled away. After being on your feet for the better part of the day, the warm car and rhythmic bumps in the road lulled you to sleep within minutes. You drooped forward in your seat and Jumin looked down at you lovingly, smiling as he repositioned your head more comfortably onto his shoulder.
