nearly an hour when you got up to knock on the bathroom door wondering why Jumin was taking so long.
 
<br><br>As you raised your fist to knock, the door opened and steam poured out, revealing Jumin, wet hair dripping, and white towel wrapped just below his waist revealing his glistening abs. “Ah Y/N, I was just about to ask why you left your pjs in here.” 
 
<br><br>“Woah--!” you choked a little at the sight of his body. “You’re showing WAY too much skin right now. And those are yours so put them on and come out already, I’ve been waiting long enough.”
 
<br><br>A few minutes later, Jumin exited the bathroom wearing the pajamas, “Babe you look so expensive in those.”
 
<br><br>“I always look expensive.”
 
<br><br>You dropped your robe revealing the same patterned PJs and a grin slowly spreads across his face.
 
<br><br>“Y/N what a lovely surprise!” You twirled for him and he walked over and planted a soft kiss on your forehead. You could feel his smiling lips as he made contact with your skin. “I didn’t expect this…thank you.” He was truly grateful. Normally he was the one buying gifts for you and that’s how he preferred things to be, so he was surprised at how emotional such a simple gift made him. You had really given him a pleasant surprise tonight. “We must take photos in these with Elizabeth III.”
 
<br><br>“Of Course!” you giggled.
 
<br><br>After posing for some photos and feeding Elizabeth III some cat-safe Christmas treats, Jumin walked past you and headed to the kitchen.
 
<br><br>“Since I didn’t let you go home,” he called out, “I’ll make this night worth your while.”
 
<br><br>He came back carrying two glasses, a platter of cheese, crackers, and fruits, and a bottle of wine tucked under his arm.
 
<br><br>The two of you sat on the couch and he filled the glasses. After a few sips, you weren’t drunk—just a little buzzed and warm. Jumin had already finished his first glass, but he was unfazed; he poured himself another and sipped it as he gazed thoughtfully at the television.
