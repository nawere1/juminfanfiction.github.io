By the time Driver Kim pulled into the driveway of Jumin’s penthouse, the snow was falling heavily, blanketing the neighborhood in a silent white shroud.     
<br><br>“Wake up, love,” Jumin urged softly as he gently shook your shoulder. Your eyes flew opened and you were met with the sight of your boyfriend’s handsome face mere centimeters from yours.
 
<br>“Hmh,” you grunted, blinking twice and looking around in bewilderment.  There had still been vibrant pink and orange hues in the sky when Driver Kim picked the two of you up, so the street lit darkness outside confused you.
“How long was I out?” You questioned rubbing your eyes, 
 
<br><br>“You were gone as soon as you buckled your seatbelt, Y/N,” Jumin chuckled, “and there’s some drool on your face by the way,” he pointed his finger in your face and you swatted his hand away, somewhat embarrassed as you wiped your lips with the back of your hand.
 
<br><br>Jumin exited the vehicle and driver Kim came around to open your door. You stepped out and immediately you were hit by a gust of wind that violently whipped your hair around and caused you to brace yourself against the car so as not to lose your balance. You held Driver Kim’s arm for support as Jumin came around the car and took Driver Kim’s place to escort you into the building. He gave the driver a grateful nod and you turned to wave, eyes and face stinging as the wind hurled powdered snow at you.
 
<br><br>~🎄~🎄~🎄~
 
<br><br>Jumin opened the front door and you scurried inside, eager to get away from the cold. 
 
<br><br>“Phewww!” you exhaled, “That was intense!”
 
<br><br>You kicked your shoes off and tossed your jacket onto a nearby chair as you flopped down onto the middle of Jumin’s grey plush sectional. “Ahhh this couch is so comfy, I wish i could stay here all night.” You sank comfortably into the sofa, dreading the thought of going back into the storm.
 
<br><br>“Why don’t you?” Jumin asked, flopping down beside you and resting his full weight against you.
 
<br><br>“I wish I could, but I have to get home and prep for my family’s Christmas dinner tomorrow. I’m just here for a drink, remember?” 
 
<br><br>“So? Why don’t you sleep here and just leave in the morning?” 
<br><br>“I won’t have enough time to prep the food I’m supposed to bring.”
